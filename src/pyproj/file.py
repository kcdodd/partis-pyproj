class FilePattern:
  """Pattern matching similar to '.gitignore'

  Parameters
  ----------
  pattern: str
  negate: bool
    A match to this pattern negates an existing match of the same name.
  dironly: bool
    This pattern is to only match the name of a directory.
  relative: bool
    This pattern is to match relative paths instead of just the base name.

  Notes
  -----
  * https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format
  * A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
  * A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front of
    the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
  * Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\").
  * An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded
    by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to
    re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
    Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any
    patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined.
    Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with
    a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".
  * The slash / is used as the directory separator. Separators may occur at the
    beginning, middle or end of the .gitignore search pattern.
  * If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern,
    then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular
    .gitignore file itself. Otherwise the pattern may also match at any level
    below the .gitignore level.
  * If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only
    match directories, otherwise the pattern can match both files and directories.
  * For example, a pattern doc/frotz/ matches doc/frotz directory, but not
    a/doc/frotz directory; however frotz/ matches frotz and a/frotz that is a
    directory (all paths are relative from the .gitignore file).
  * An asterisk "*" matches anything except a slash. The character "?" matches
    any one character except "/". The range notation, e.g. [a-zA-Z], can be used
    to match one of the characters in a range. See fnmatch(3) and the FNM_PATHNAME
    flag for a more detailed description.
  * Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname
    may have special meaning:
  * A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example,
    "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as pattern "foo".
    "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that is directly under
    directory "foo".
  * A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all
    files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore file,
    with infinite depth.
  * A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or
    more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b"
    and so on.
  * Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will match
    according to the previous rules.
