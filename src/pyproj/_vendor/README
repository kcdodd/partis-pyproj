The tomli parser vendors here has been modified to use relative imports instead
of absolute imports to allow usage without actually installing as a package.
The dist-info/WHEEL hashes will not be correct, but included for reference.

For example:

  from ._parser import ...

instead of:

  from tomli._parser import
